# springboot-sse-reactive

This is a simple demo showing how you can display Server Sent Events using Spring 5 WebFlux. The project uses Thymeleaf and Webjars to call Reactive Flux Endpoints which will display famous quotes, the time, etc.

To run the demo download or clone the project, and in that directory run the command mvn clean spring-boot:run or import it into your favorite IDE.
